    "section": "",
    "text": "There are different ways to solve issues, depending on the type of the problem faced during coding. You don’t know the source of an error message? Do you suspect a bug in the used packages? Are you requesting further development of a package? Such questions may be proper in some channels but in other not. Here some hints.\n\nGetting Help in R\nThe basic function help() can be used to browse the documentation of a function or data set but sometimes also documentation o a package. An alias is the operator ? followed by the symbol of the function or data set.\nTo search by a topic, you can use help.search() or ??, while help.start() takes you to the home of the R help pages.\nFurther support is offered by demos (demo()) and vignettes (functions browsevignette() and vignette()). Furthermore there is a huge number of useful tutorials available on the Internet.\nHere some example of code asking for support.\n\n# Documentation of a function\n?mean\n\n# Search by topic\n??\"linear regression\"\n\n# See a demo\ndemo(\"graphics\")\n\n# See a vignette\nvignette(\"ggplot2-specs\")\n\n# Search forum at r-project.org\nRSiteSearch(\"logistic regression\")\n\n\n\nChannels in Internet\nOne of the most common places to ask for questions related to R and other programming languages is stack overflow. This service is for free and you can browse in the discussions without any membership. For asking questions you have to register and there is a system of reputation metrics that is restrictive at the beginning but rewards your engagement in the network.\nSocial media are also alternatives for askig and discussing topics related with your work in R. They may also offer the option of creating groups for such discussions. Here a personal recommendation is the grou Ecology in R at facebook.\nAny online searching machine may also drive you to diverse forums and tutorials on the Internet.\nIn the especial case that you suspect a bug in a package or wish new features in existing packages, many of them may be developed at DevOps platforms such as GitHub and GitLab. In such cases you can report issues after registering. Alternative you can contact developers per e-mail.\n\n\nGood Practices\nHere a personal check-list for asking questions and reporting issues.\n\nTake your time searching for existing answers in internet\nKESS (keep it simple stupid)\nUse minimal reproducible examples\nBe polite\nTag, comment or report the solution\nUse Markdown if suitable"
