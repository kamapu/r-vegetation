We will do a refresh on [**R**](https://cran.r-project.org/) basics focussing on data types, objects, and
methods.
This session includes a brief introduction on [**R
Markdown**](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and taxonomic resolution.

We dedicate this session to data formats and arrangements.
Here we will introduce to the
