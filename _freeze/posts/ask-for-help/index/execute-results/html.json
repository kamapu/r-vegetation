Do you suspect a bug in the used\npackages? Are you requesting further development of a package? Such questions\nmay be proper in some channels but in other not. Here some hints.\n\n# Getting Help in R\n\nThe basic function `help()` can be used to browse the documentation of a\nfunction or data set but sometimes also documentation o a package.\nAn alias is the operator `?` followed by the symbol of the function or data\nset.\n\nTo search by a topic, you can use `help.search()` or `??`, while\n`help.start()` takes you to the home of the R help pages.\n\nFurther support is offered by demos (`demo()`) and vignettes\n(functions `browsevignette()` and `vignette()`).\nFurthermore there is a huge number of useful tutorials available on the\nInternet.\n\nHere some example of code asking for support.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Documentation of a function\n?mean\n\n# Search by topic\n??\"linear regression\"\n\n# See a demo\ndemo(\"graphics\")\n\n# See a vignette\nvignette(\"ggplot2-specs\")\n\n# Search forum at r-project.org\nRSiteSearch(\"logistic regression\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Channels in Internet\n\nOne of the most common places to ask for questions related to R and other\nprogramming languages is [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).\nThis service is for free and you can browse in the discussions without any\nmembership.\nFor asking questions you have to register and there is a system of reputation\nmetrics that is restrictive at the beginning but rewards your engagement in the\nnetwork.\n\nSocial media are also alternatives for askig and discussing topics related with\nyour work in R. They may also offer the option of creating groups for such\ndiscussions. Here a personal recommendation is the grou\n[Ecology in R](https://www.facebook.com/groups/302253597304209) at facebook.\n\nAny online searching machine may also drive you to diverse forums and tutorials\non the Internet.\n\nIn the especial case that you suspect a bug in a package or wish new features\nin existing packages, many of them may be developed at DevOps platforms such as\n[GitHub](https://github.com/) and [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/). In such\ncases you can report issues after registering. Alternative you can contact\ndevelopers per e-mail.\n\n# Good Practices\n\nHere a personal check-list for asking questions and reporting issues.\n\n- Take your time searching for existing answers in internet\n- KESS (*keep it simple stupid*)\n- Use **minimal reproducible examples**\n- Be polite\n- Tag, comment or report the solution\n- Use **Markdown** if suitable\n",
