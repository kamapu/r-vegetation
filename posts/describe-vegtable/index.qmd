# Task

Import the data set **sanmartin1998.rds** into your R-Session and summary
taxonomy and species attributes for each plot.

Describe different plant communities according to those statistics.

Do some descriptive statistics on the basis of taxonomic and environmental
variables stored at `object@header`.

Here a suggested code to import and explore the content of the object:

```{r results="hide"}
releves <- readRDS("sanmartin1998.rds")
releves
releves <- relation2header(vegtable = releves,
    relation = "community_type")
summary(as.factor(releves$community_name))
```

# Alternatives

You can use other distributed data sets or own data formatted to vegtable.

# Trained Skills

- Understanding about data structure in `vegtable` objects.
- Overview of taxonomic attributes stored in `taxlist` objects.
