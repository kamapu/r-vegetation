The next is a list of blog posts dealing with the work with `taxlist` and
`vegtable`. Most of those examples may be reproducible an help to exercise
the work with these packages.

- The [taxlist home page](https://docs.ropensci.org/taxlist/) includes some
  examples working with the installed data set and links to vigenettes and
  documentation of functions.
- The [vegtable home page](http://kamapu.github.io/vegtable/) has also few examples for doing sub sets and mapping
  with `leaflet`.
- In [Basics on the work with vegetation-plots in
  vegtable](https://kamapu.github.io/posts/vegtable-press-2/) there is a more
  extended explanation about `taxlist` and `vegtable` with one example.
- Another extended explanation using data from Kenian forests is displayed in
  [Introduction to the package
  vegtable](https://kamapu.github.io/posts/vegtable-intro/)
- One of the newest posts is
  [Vegetation of East African
  wetlands - Assessment using R
  and vegtable](https://kamapu.github.io/posts/ea-wetlands/) explaining the
  code used for a publication dealing with the classification of wetland
  vegetation in East Africa.
